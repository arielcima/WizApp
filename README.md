# Wiz smart bulbs basic app controller

I made this small android app using Claude Code to be able to control Wiz lightbulbs without using the app or installing a dedicated Home Assistant server. No accounts, no cloud, no internet needed. You just need to have your phone in the same network as the bulbs. (You will need the Wiz app to set that up first).


I vibed this whole thing so I'm not sure how good it is. I never made an android app before.

# Compatibility
I only managed to test it in an old Motorola EDGE.

# Next Steps
- Add groups to control entire rooms.
- Make an iOS version. (If possible, don't know if Tim Apple will let me)
